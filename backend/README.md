# BioSense Care Backend

This is the backend for the BioSense Care application. It is a Node.js application using Express and TypeScript.

## Running the backend

To run the backend server, follow these steps:

1.  Open a terminal and navigate to this `backend` directory.
2.  Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  Start the server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

The server will start on `http://localhost:3001`.cd

## Running the full application

To run the full application, you need to have both the backend and frontend servers running.

1.  Start the backend server as described above.
2.  Open a new terminal and navigate to the root directory of the project (`biosense-care-main`).
3.  Install the frontend dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
4.  Start the frontend development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is in use).
